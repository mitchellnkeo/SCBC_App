## 🏛️ **Architecture Decisions**

### **User Role System**

- **Admins inherit** all member permissions plus moderation
- **Role-based UI** rendering and API access
- **Scalable design** for future role additions

### **Event System Design**
- **Democratic creation:** Events created by any member
- **Admin approval:** Non-admin events require approval
- **RSVP system** with attendance tracking
- **Comment threads** with reply functionality and @mentions
- **Calendar integration** for reminders

### **State Management Strategy**
- **Zustand** for global state (auth, events, settings)
- **React Hook Form** for form state and validation
- **Firebase real-time listeners** for live data updates
- **AsyncStorage** for persistent user preferences

### **Theme Architecture**
- **React Context** for theme state management
- **Dynamic StyleSheet** generation based on current theme
- **Consistent color system** across all components
- **Platform-aware** styling (iOS/Android differences)

## 💰 **Cost Considerations**

### **Development Phase:** Essentially free
### **Production Costs:**
- **Apple Developer:** $99/year
- **Google Play:** $25 one-time
- **Firebase:** Likely $10-30/month with 300 active users
