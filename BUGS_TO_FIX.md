## üìù Fixed Issues

### ‚úÖ Date Picker Auto-Selection Issue
**Fixed:** Current Session  
**Issue:** Date picker automatically selected dates while user was scrolling/browsing, making it difficult to choose specific dates  
**Solution:** 
- Added temporary date state for browsing on iOS
- Implemented manual confirmation buttons (Cancel/Confirm) for iOS
- Maintained Android default behavior while improving iOS UX
- Users can now scroll through dates freely and confirm their selection manually

### ‚úÖ Keyboard returnKeyType Implementation
**Fixed:** Current  
**Issue:** TextInput fields didn't have proper "Done" buttons for keyboard dismissal  
**Solution:** Added `returnKeyType="done"` and `onSubmitEditing` handlers to major forms

### ‚úÖ Deprecated blurOnSubmit Warning
**Fixed:** Current  
**Issue:** React Native warning about deprecated `blurOnSubmit` prop  
**Solution:** Replaced with `submitBehavior` prop

### ~~Time Input UX Enhancement~~ ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - January 2025

**Problem Description**:
- ~~Single time input field was insufficient for events with clear start/end times~~
- ~~Users had to manually type time strings without validation~~
- ~~No clear indication of event duration for attendees~~
- ~~Inconsistent time formatting across the app~~

**Impact**:
- ~~Unclear event duration for attendees making it hard to plan~~
- ~~Potential for time input errors and inconsistent formatting~~
- ~~Poor user experience when creating/editing events~~

**Solution Implemented**:
- ‚úÖ **Replaced single time input with start/end time picker component**
- ‚úÖ **Native time picker integration**: iOS spinner and Android clock interfaces
- ‚úÖ **Smart time validation**: Prevents end time before start time
- ‚úÖ **Auto-suggestion**: 2-hour duration suggested when start time is selected
- ‚úÖ **Visual time range display**: Shows "7:00 PM - 9:00 PM" format throughout app
- ‚úÖ **Platform-optimized UX**: iOS modal with Cancel/Confirm, Android direct selection
- ‚úÖ **Backward compatibility**: Seamless migration from old single time field
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive time formatting**: Consistent display across all components

**Technical Details**:
- Created new `TimePicker` component with full time management capabilities
- Updated data structure from `time: string` to `startTime: string, endTime: string`
- Implemented backward compatibility for existing events with legacy time field
- Updated all display components to handle both old and new time formats

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/common/TimePicker.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/types/index.ts` (data structure updates)
- All event screens and components updated for new time structure

**Result**: Professional time range display with intuitive native time selection, making events much clearer for both organizers and attendees.

## üÜï Recently Fixed Issues

### ‚úÖ TimePicker UX Improvements
**Fixed:** Current Session  
**Issue:** TimePicker had poor user experience with auto-selection on scroll and unreliable time setting  
**Solution:** 
- **iOS**: Restored modal with Cancel/Confirm buttons to prevent auto-selection while scrolling
- **Android**: Maintained native behavior with immediate selection 
- **Direct picker access**: Time picker opens immediately when input field is tapped (no intermediate dialogs)
- **Reliable time setting**: Eliminated buggy temp state management that caused blank fields
- **Platform-optimized behavior**: iOS spinner with manual confirmation, Android clock with auto-confirm
- **Smart auto-suggestion**: End time suggestion only when needed, doesn't interfere with manual selection

### ‚úÖ TimePicker Final Fixes - Complete Resolution
**Fixed:** Current Session  
**Issue:** Final bugs with TimePicker including start time not displaying in UI and unwanted auto-suggestion  
**Solution:** 
- **Fixed start time display**: Resolved state update timing issue where start time wasn't appearing in UI field after selection
- **Removed auto-suggestion**: Eliminated automatic end time suggestion feature per user preference
- **Eliminated circular parsing**: Fixed buggy parsing loop that caused random end time values
- **Direct Date object usage**: Modified confirmStartTime to use tempStartTime Date object directly instead of re-parsing formatted strings
- **Enhanced debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to track state flow and identify issues
- **Clean validation**: Fixed time range validation to properly handle "9:30 AM to 11:00 AM" format
- **Result**: TimePicker now works perfectly with reliable time setting, no auto-suggestion, and proper validation

### ‚úÖ TimePicker Unicode Whitespace Parsing Bug
**Fixed:** Current Session  
**Issue:** Time validation was failing with "End time must be after start time" error even for valid ranges like "4:00 PM to 6:00 PM"  
**Root Cause:** The `toLocaleTimeString` function was producing time strings with Unicode whitespace characters (like non-breaking space U+00A0) instead of regular ASCII spaces, causing `split(' ')` to fail  
**Solution:** 
- **Fixed parsing regex**: Changed from `split(' ')` to `split(/\s+/)` to handle any Unicode whitespace characters
- **Robust time parsing**: Now correctly splits "4:00 PM" into ["4:00", "PM"] regardless of whitespace type
- **Eliminated false validation errors**: Time range validation now works correctly for all time formats
- **Platform compatibility**: Handles different locale formatting across iOS/Android devices
- **Result**: No more false "End time must be after start time" errors, reliable time validation for all Unicode whitespace variants

### ‚úÖ Past Date/Time Validation
**Fixed:** Current Session  
**Issue:** Users could create or edit events with dates/times that had already passed, leading to invalid events  
**Solution:** 
- Added comprehensive validation to prevent past date/time selection
- Date pickers already had `minimumDate={new Date()}` to prevent past dates
- Enhanced form validation to check same-day events with past start/end times
- Added `eventDate` prop to TimePicker component for context-aware validation
- Shows specific error messages: "Start time cannot be in the past" and "End time cannot be in the past"
- Applied to both CreateEventScreen and EditEventScreen
- Example: If it's September 9th, 2025 11am, users cannot create events starting before 11am that same day

### ‚úÖ Event Card Time Layout Overflow
**Fixed:** Current Session  
**Issue:** Date and time text was overflowing in event cards when displayed in card view, making text unreadable  
**Solution:** 
- Separated date and time into separate lines instead of concatenating them into one long string
- Added proper flex styling with `flex: 1` and `numberOfLines={1}` to prevent overflow
- Used consistent indentation with `marginLeft: 26` for time alignment
- Applied fix to `AllEventsTab.tsx`, `PastEventsTab.tsx`, and `MyEventsTab.tsx`
- Now displays cleanly with date on first line and time range on second line

### ‚úÖ Event Card Time Display Issue
**Fixed:** Current Session  
**Issue:** Event cards were displaying incorrect single times (e.g., "9:47pm") instead of proper time ranges (e.g., "11:00am-12:00pm")  
**Solution:** 
- Fixed `formatTime` functions in `PastEventsTab.tsx` and `AllEventsTab.tsx` to use new `startTime` and `endTime` fields
- Updated time display calls from `formatTime(event.date)` to `formatTime(event.startTime, event.endTime)`
- Cleaned up unused `formatPSTTime` imports
- Now correctly shows time ranges like "11:00 AM - 1:00 PM" throughout the app

### ‚úÖ Date Picker Auto-Selection Issue
**Fixed:** Current Session  
**Issue:** Date picker automatically selected dates while user was scrolling/browsing, making it difficult to choose specific dates  
**Solution:** 
- Added temporary date state for browsing on iOS
- Implemented manual confirmation buttons (Cancel/Confirm) for iOS  
- Maintained Android default behavior while improving iOS UX
- Users can now scroll through dates freely and confirm their selection manually
- Updated both CreateEventScreen and EditEventScreen
